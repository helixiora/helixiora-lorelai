# PyTest

We need tests soon.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on individual pieces of code, such as functions or methods, ensuring they work
correctly in isolation without requiring the entire application to run. They are essential for
verifying the functionality of specific components and are typically fast and simple to write.

## Integration Tests

Integration tests evaluate the interaction between multiple components or systems, verifying that
they work together as expected. These tests cover end-to-end scenarios and are crucial for
identifying issues in the interaction between integrated parts of the application.

## Frontend Tests

Frontend tests, often using tools like Selenium, simulate real browser interactions to ensure that
the user interface behaves as expected. These tests help validate that the web application's
frontend is functioning correctly from a user's perspective, covering elements like form
submissions, navigation, and visual consistency.

## Flask-Testing

For applications built with Flask, Flask-Testing provides tools and extensions to facilitate
testing. It offers a framework for testing Flask applications, making it easier to create unit and
integration tests for your Flask projects.

For more information, refer to the official Flask-Testing documentation:
[Flask Testing Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/testing/).
